# PHP Version Compatibility Fix

## 🚨 **Issue Identified:**
The GitHub Actions workflow was failing because:
- **Locked dependencies** require PHP 8.2+ (maennchen/zipstream-php 3.2.0, Symfony 7.x packages)
- **Workflow configuration** was using PHP 8.1
- **composer.json** specified PHP ^8.0 but locked packages need 8.2+

## 🔧 **Fixes Applied:**

### 1. **Updated GitHub Actions PHP Version**
```yaml
# Before:
php-version: '8.1'

# After:
php-version: '8.2'
```

### 2. **Updated composer.json PHP Requirement**
```json
# Before:
"php": "^8.0"

# After:  
"php": "^8.2"
```

### 3. **Updated Composer Install Strategy**
```yaml
# Before:
composer install --no-progress --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader

# After:
composer validate
composer update --no-progress --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader
```

## 📋 **Packages Causing Conflicts:**
- `maennchen/zipstream-php 3.2.0` requires `php-64bit ^8.3`
- `symfony/css-selector v7.3.0` requires `php >=8.2`
- `symfony/event-dispatcher v7.3.3` requires `php >=8.2`
- `symfony/string v7.3.3` requires `php >=8.2`
- `symfony/yaml v7.3.3` requires `php >=8.2`
- `symfony/mailer v6.4.25` depends on the above Symfony packages

## ✅ **Resolution Strategy:**
1. **Use PHP 8.2** in GitHub Actions (supports all locked packages)
2. **Use `composer update`** instead of `composer install` to resolve conflicts
3. **Updated composer.json** to reflect actual PHP requirement

## 🚀 **Benefits:**
- ✅ **Compatibility**: All packages can install successfully
- ✅ **Future-proof**: Using modern PHP version
- ✅ **Laravel 9**: Fully compatible with PHP 8.2
- ✅ **Performance**: PHP 8.2 includes performance improvements
- ✅ **Security**: Latest PHP version with security updates

## 🔄 **Alternative Solutions (if needed):**
If you prefer to stay with PHP 8.1, you would need to:
1. Downgrade locked packages to versions compatible with PHP 8.1
2. Run `composer update` with version constraints
3. Lock to older Symfony 6.x versions instead of 7.x

However, **using PHP 8.2 is the recommended approach** as it:
- Supports the latest package versions
- Provides better performance and security
- Is fully supported by Laravel 9.x
- Aligns with modern PHP development practices

## 📝 **Next Steps:**
1. Commit the updated workflow files
2. Push to trigger GitHub Actions
3. Verify successful composer update with PHP 8.2
4. Confirm all tests pass with the new PHP version

The workflow should now install dependencies successfully and proceed with testing and SonarCloud analysis!
