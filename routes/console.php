| This file is where you may define all of your Closure based console
| commands. Each Closure is bound to a command instance allowing a
| simple approach to interacting with each command's IO methods.
|
| Note: Console commands have been moved to class-based commands in
| app/Console/Commands/ and are registered in app/Console/Kernel.php

// Console commands are now registered as classes in Kernel.php
// Example: InspireCommand::class is registered in the commands() method
